# Heart_Disease_Analysis
This investigation is particularly relevant given that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the principal cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for a staggering 17.9 million deaths in 2015 alone.
# Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset

## Project Overview
This project involves an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 17.9 million deaths in 2015 alone. This analysis aims to uncover insights that could inform further research and predictive modeling in the field of healthcare.

## Key Highlights of the Project

### Introduction to EDA
- Explored the significance of EDA in understanding data distributions, identifying outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables.

### Objectives
- Provide insights into the dataset's distribution.
- Check for missing values.
- Discover patterns that could inform further analysis.

### Data Import and Preparation
- Utilized Python libraries such as:
  - **Pandas**: for data manipulation.
  - **NumPy**: for numerical operations.
  - **Seaborn**: for statistical data visualization.
  - **Matplotlib**: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Analyzed the target variable (presence of heart disease) and its relationship with other features like age, sex, and chest pain type.
- Visualizations included:
  - Count plots
  - Correlation matrices

### Multivariate Analysis
- Employed heat maps and pair plots to discover complex relationships among multiple variables, enhancing our understanding of how they interact.

### Outlier Detection
- Identified outliers in key numerical variables, which is essential for ensuring the robustness of any predictive models developed later.

### Conclusion
- Summarized findings that highlighted the importance of certain features in predicting heart disease, paving the way for future machine learning applications.

## Future Work
This project not only deepened my understanding of EDA but also reinforced the importance of data-driven insights in healthcare. Future work could involve developing predictive models based on the insights gained from this analysis.
